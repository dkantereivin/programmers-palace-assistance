Hey!

I just made this README because I felt it was the right thing to do.
I tried to make this a bit less tiring to read, but yeah.
So, to use my proyect, you need to have installed the time module and the keyboard module.
Just pip install time, pip install keyboard and you'll be set!

To use my program, put the initial number you want to start counting from, and after hitting enter, quickly switch
to a text editor or a Discord channel, both work fine, and let the program do the rest

Feel free to organize my code, It's super messy... -w-
